# social-media-bots
Automated comment &amp; like bots made with python + selenium.  

# InstaCommenter
Adds comments to specified number of photos on target's instagram profile.  

Every comment is a combination of one cliché phrase (ex. *Loff, Mojaa, SztosiQ, Najss, 11/10, Jest mocc, Bejbii*) and one of many emoji combinations (ex. 💫⭐☀, 🔥😍, 🌸🍬, 💓💓🔥, 💪💓) resulting in a random assortment of pure cringe. This methods makes it harder for Instagram to detect this script as spam bot.

# FacebookLiker
Likes specified number of posts on target's facebook wall.

*Notice: I did not use the script in malicious intent. My only target was my alt-accounts for testing purposes.*
